# street-sensor-selection

Code for the numerical simulations contained in the monograph "Optimal Sensor Selection for Traffic Flow Monitoring and Estimation: A System Observability Perspective", by Marco Fabris and Angelo Cenedese.

How to run the code:
0) Optional: generate setup using main.py (thanks to Luca Varotto and Alessandra Zampieri)
1) Run MAIN.m after having set correctly all the paths to generate the numerical results (careful: it may take several hours for some methods to finish).
